    README file of the Test suite for ParetoLib
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The following file contains information about every data file used in the test
suite of ParetoLib. The structure of the Test folder is divided in three parts,
one for each kind of Oracle. Internally, each folder is organised in three subfolders
depending on the dimension of the Oracle (OracleSTL and OracleSTLe also includes
the trivial case of 1D).
A detailed description of the examples is found inside each specific path.
