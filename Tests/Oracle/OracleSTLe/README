    README file of the Test suite for ParetoLib
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This README contains information about every data file used in the test
suite of ParetoLib for OracleSTLe. Each *.[txt|bin] file defines an OracleSTLe.
OracleSTLe is an oracle that evaluates parametrised Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
formulas for guiding the discovery of closures.
OracleSTLe uses the external tool STLe for evaluating STL formulas.
So, part of the information contained in the *.[txt|bin] file correspond to
the configuration and running environment of STLe.

The files required by the STLe tool are:
- A signal in CSV format (*.csv).
- A parametrised STL specification (*.stl).

OracleSTLe needs an extra configuration file (*.param) for pointing out the
parameters of the STL formula that it will consider.

All the examples are classified in folders (1D/2D/3D/ND) depending on the
number of parameters in the STL formula (i.e., 2 parameters for 2D, 3 parameters
for 3D and so on). Example named 'stabilization' is extracted from [1], section 5.

    File format
"""""""""""""""""
There are two kind of files (*.txt, *.bin):
- *.txt are textual human-readable files.

The three first lines of the *.txt are filenames.
They correspond to files required by the JAMT tool.
The first line points to the file containing a parametrised STL formula.
The STLe will check a particular instance of this STL formula over a signal.
The second line points to the file containing a representation of the signal in CSV format.
The last line is a file that contains the list of parameters of the STL formula.
These parameters implicitly define the n-dimensional space of the Pareto search, i.e.,
the first parameter matches the coordinate 'x', the second parameter matches the coordinate 'y' and so on.
The dimension of the n-dimensional space is equal to the number of parameters in the STL formula.

- *.bin are binary files created by the serialization of Oracles with the Python's Pickle library.
