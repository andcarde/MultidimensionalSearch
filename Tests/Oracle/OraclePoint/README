    README file of the Test suite for ParetoLib
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This README contains information about every data file used in the test
suite of ParetoLib for OraclePoint. Each file defines a OraclePoint.

2D/3D
- test-2d-[6|12]points.txt: Oracle that has a set of [6|12] points obtained by evaluating a linear function (diagonal)
- test-2d-10points.txt: Oracle that has a set of 10 points obtained by evaluating an inverse function (hyperbola)
- test-[2|3]d-[1000|2000|10000]points.txt: Oracle that has a set of X points of [2|3]-dimension. They are LIDAR points
 extracted from the adaptation of:

ND
- test-Nd-Xpoints.bin: Oracle that has a set of X random points of N-dimension


    File format
"""""""""""""""""
There are two kind of files (*.txt, *.bin):
- *.txt are textual human-readable files.
Each line of the file represents a point in the closure.
Every point is defined by a tuple with the format '(x, y, z)',
The dimension of the n-dimensional space is implicitly defined by the number of
coordinates in the tuple.

- *.bin are binary files created by the serialization of Oracles with the Python's Pickle library.
