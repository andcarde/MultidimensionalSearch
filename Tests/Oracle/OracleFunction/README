    README file of the Test suite for ParetoLib
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This README contains information about every data file used in the test
suite of ParetoLib for OracleFunction. Each file defines a OracleFunction:

2D/3D
- test1.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a linear function (diagonal)
- test2.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a quadratic function (parabola)
- test3.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using an inverse function (hyperbola)
- test4.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a circumference/sphere
- test5.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a simplex

ND
- simplex-4d.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a 4D simplex
- simplex-5d.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a 5D simplex
- sphere-4d.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a 4D sphere
- sphere-5d.txt: Oracle that specifies the closure membership using a 5D sphere

By default, all the Oracles consider n-dimensional spaces where the range of each axe is [0,1].

    File format
"""""""""""""""""
There are two kind of files (*.txt, *.bin):
- *.txt are textual human-readable files.
Each line of the file represents an equation that must be satisfied by a point in the closure.
The dimension of the n-dimensional space is implicitly defined by the set of equations.
Every variable is associated with a dimension of the space by lexicographical order of the
variable names.
For instance, in equation 'x + y + z > 0' variable 'x' will correspond to dimension 1,
variable 'y' will correspond to dimension 2 and variable 'z' will correspond to dimension 3.

- *.bin are binary files created by the serialization of Oracles with the Python's Pickle library.
