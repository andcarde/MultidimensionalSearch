Parameter 'p2' is changed to 'mp2' (minus, -) in order to making the STL monotone.
The parameter domain of 'mp2' is the complementary of 'p2'.

The validity interval for 'p1' and 'mp2' is p1 + mp2 >= 0, p1 >= 0
It is recommended to invoke the Pareto multidimensional search in the parametric space [-2.0, 2.0] for p1 and mp2
