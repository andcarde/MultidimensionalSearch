Parameter 'p2' is changed to 'mp2' (minus, -) in order to making the STL monotone.
The parameter domain of 'mp2' is the complementary of 'p2'.

The validity interval for 'p1' is p1 >= 8
The validity interval for 'mp2' is mp2 >= 2.6*10^-6 (i.e., p2 <= -2.6*10^-6)

It is recommended to invoke the Pareto multidimensional search in the parametric space [-2.0, 10.0] for p1 and mp2
