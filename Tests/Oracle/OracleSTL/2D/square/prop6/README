Parameter 'p2' is changed to 'mp2' (minus, -) in order to making the STL monotone.
The parameter domain of 'mp2' is the complementary of 'p2'.

The validity interval for 'p1' is p1 >= 1
The validity interval for 'mp2' is mp2 >= -1 (i.e., p2 <= 1)

It is recommended to invoke the Pareto multidimensional search in the parametric space [-2.0, 2.0] for p1 and mp2
