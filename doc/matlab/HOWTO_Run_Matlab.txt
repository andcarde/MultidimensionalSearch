Start Python, import the module, and start the MATLAB engine:

import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()

Stop Engine
Call either the exit or the quit function.

eng.quit()
If you exit Python with an engine still running, then Python automatically stops the engine and its MATLAB process.

Start Engine with Startup Options
Start the engine and pass the options as an input argument string to matlab.engine.start_matlab. For example, start MATLAB with the desktop.

eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab("-desktop")
You can define multiple startup options with a single string. For example, start the desktop and set the numeric display format to short.

eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab("-desktop -r 'format short'")
You also can start the desktop after you start the engine.

import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
eng.desktop(nargout=0)
Start Engine Asynchronously
Start the engine asynchronously. While MATLAB starts, you can enter commands at the Python command line.

import matlab.engine
future = matlab.engine.start_matlab(background=True)
Create the MATLAB instance so you can perform computations in MATLAB.

eng = future.result()
